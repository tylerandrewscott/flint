X Not applicable.	   
[1] A household that has at least one member of the household related to the householder by birth, marriage, or  adoption is a "Family household."  Same-sex couple households are included in the family households category if there is at least one additional person related to the householder by birth or adoption.  Same-sex couple households with no relatives of the householder present are tabulated in nonfamily households.  Responses of "same-sex spouse" were edited during processing to "unmarried partner."	   
[2] "Nonfamily households" consist of people living alone and households which do not have any members related to the householder.	   
[3] "Families" consist of a householder and one or more other people related to the householder by birth, marriage, or adoption.  They do not include same-sex married couples even if the marriage was performed in a state issuing marriage certificates for same-sex couples.  Same-sex couples are included in the families category if there is at least one additional person related to the householder by birth or adoption.  Responses of "same-sex spouse" were edited during processing to "unmarried partner."  Same-sex couple households with no relatives of the householder present are tabulated in nonfamily households.
